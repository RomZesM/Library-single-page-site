For a long time I worked as a doctor. It was boring, and one day I made an application based on Microsoft Acces to speed up the work with the current documentation. And I liked it. I started studying Computer Science, C, then Java, and now I realized that the program should not only work stably, but also look beautiful. I need something more than just html. So - I'm here.

## Code example

*Example from Codewars:* **You get an array of numbers, return the sum of all of the positives ones.**

                    *Example [1,-4,7,12] => 1 + 7 + 12 = 20*

*Note: if there is nothing to sum, the sum is default to 0.*
```
function positiveSum(arr) {
    let summ = 0;

    for(let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++){
        if((parseInt(arr[i]) >= 0))
            summ += parseInt(arr[i])
    }
    return summ
}
```
