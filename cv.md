For a long time I worked as a doctor. It was boring, and one day I made an application based on Microsoft Acces to speed up the work with the current documentation. And I liked it. I started studying Computer Science, C, then Java, and now I realized that the program should not only work stably, but also look beautiful. I need something more than just html. So - I'm here.
